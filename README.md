Welcome to my ABAP Learning Portfolio — a collection of examples, exercises, and small projects created while learning ABAP Cloud on SAP BTP using Eclipse ADT.

This repository documents my progress as I learn:

Modern ABAP Cloud syntax

Object-Oriented ABAP (OO)

Working with internal tables and data structures

Open SQL operations

Running code using ADB (ABAP Console Applications)

Exploring the RESTful ABAP Programming Model (RAP)

Understanding packages, transports, and software components in ABAP Environment

All code here is written by me for practice, learning, and experimentation.

**Goals of This Repository**
Build a strong foundation in modern ABAP
Practice clean and readable code
Understand ABAP Cloud concepts and restrictions
Prepare for real-world ABAP development on SAP BTP
Have a public portfolio to showcase during interviews
Track progress over time
